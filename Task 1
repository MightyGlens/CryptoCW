Write a program that provides both encryption and decryption operations to an affine cipher
m = 0...n-1 (and mapping from a letter of an alphabet of size n)
Enc(m) = am+b mod n
b = random integers with gcd(a,b) = 1
a,b = private encryption keys 

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int m;
char str[1000];

printf("Please enter plaintext:/n");
gets(str);











}
